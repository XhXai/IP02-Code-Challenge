# CODE-CHALLENGE.

#### In this project I'm going to be implementing a mini web app to practice on components, props, state, events and data fetching in react. Created on the 01/05/2023.

## Mini Web App
In this web app, Iâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of available bots, among other features. The user will be able to see profiles of all bots, add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it, release a bot from my army by clicking on it, Discharge a bot from their service forever.

## Technologies Used.
In this particular code challenge I used Reactjs programming language,Visual Studio Code to write the code and Github to store the code.
