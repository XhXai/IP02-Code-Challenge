# CODE-CHALLENGE.

#### In this project I'm going to be implementing a mini web app to practice on components, props, state, events and data fetching in react. Created on the 01/05/2023.

## Mini Web App
In this web app, you should be able to see table of all transactions, Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table, Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

## Technologies Used.
In this particular code challenge I used Reactjs programming language,Visual Studio Code to write the code and Github to store the code.
